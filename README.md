# imageNoiseFiltering

The algorithm receives an input image and the user selects the type of noise to add. Then the user decides which filter he wants to use to eliminate the noise and at the end the original image, the image with noise, the filtered image, the noise generated and the estimated noise are displayed. In addition, the mean square error and the execution time of each filter are calculated and displayed in the console.

Note: You can save the generated images uncommenting the commented lines in the "show" method of the "Noise" class
